        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Last updated: January 23, 2021</p>
        <p>Since this is only a static site, we don't collect any data at all. We do plan on implementing a live database sometime in the future. When we do, we will collect basic data like first names and last names. However, a live data base has not been implemented yet. At this moment, no data is collected by us. If this changes in the future, there will be a prominent banner on the first page and this section will be modified.</p>

        <h1 style="font-size: 30px;">Our Mission</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">We wish to provide a platform that can give accurate results to whether a personâ€™s wage is fair compared to the majority. We also want to make sure to inform people which groups of people are affected by the wage gap issue and the ways they can contribute to helping resolve this issue in the case that they are the people affected by the wage gap issue.</p>
        <h1 style="font-size: 30px;">Facts about gender wage gaps</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>According to surveys done by Randstand US, 80% of women would switch to companies that have more gender equality</li>
            <li>In an Ontario government report, women with the same credentials as men earn on average $7200 less than their male counterparts</li>
            <li>If current trends continue, it will take 217 years for the gender gap to close</li>
            <li>If equal pay is acheived between male and female workers, it will cut women poverty rate by 50%</li>
            <li>Due to women's lower earning power, they more likely to stay in abusive relationships because they feel like they won't be able to support themselves</li>

        </ul>

        </ul>

        <h1 style="font-size: 30px;">What to do after discovering a wage gap?</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Contact others who are apart of your workplace to try the website and see the results to make sure that it is not just an individual issue</li>
          <li>Create a petition if it looks like there seem to be multiple people who have gotten results that show that their salary is lower than average</li>
          <li>Address these issues to your manager as a group</li>

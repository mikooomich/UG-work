Hi.
Use navbar in header to navigate pages. In phone width mode use the dropdown in the header to see nav bar menu.
Click on past projects when not logged in (or login button) to see the sign in/log in page. The long button switches between sign up and login.
The tiny delete button is in the footer on the right side, please spam click around it to activate it. Usually it activates toward the right side or upper right side
To delete account you need to be logged in.
